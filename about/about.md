## about this project
*This is an interactive musical web app*

This app contains four sections designed to demonstrate essential elements of a digital music system: audio samples, synthesizers, sequences, and automation. For each section, there is a single data file (JSON format) that defines the musical objects that will play in response to user actions. 

Each of these components will function with the others. Detailed instructions are embedded in each section of this app. Further instructions, resources, and guides are available on Sakai for COMP/MUSC 122.
